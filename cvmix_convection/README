POP2-CESM kernels
altuntas@ucar.edu

The kernels are to be used for optimization/verification studies and usually consist of 
 (1) a main Fortran module including the subroutine targeted for optimization/verification.
     In this kernel, (1) is:
        cvmix_coeffs_conv_low (in cvmix_convection module @ cvmix_convection.F90)
 (2) auxiliary modules required for dependencies
 (3) data sampled from an actual model run and to be used to run the kernels
 (4) the kernel driver.


Description of the targeted subroutine:
    The kernel subroutine "cvmix_coeffs_conv_low" computes vertical diffusion coefficients 
    for convective mixing. The subroutine corresponds to about 0.5% of ocean-only CESM runs.
    The module is part of CVMix, a library for parameterizing ocean vertical mixing processes.


Notes on Kernel Extraction:
 (*) The following kgen commands were executed to extract this kernel on cheyenne:

  target=$cesmdir/components/pop/externals/CVMix/src/shared/cvmix_convection.F90

  $kgen $target --cmd-clean "cd $casedir; ./case.build --clean-all" --cmd-build "cd $casedir; ./case.build" --cmd-run "cd $casedir; ./case.submit" --timing "repeat=1"  --mpi comm=mpi_communicator_ocn,use="ocn_communicator:mpi_communicator_ocn",header="/glade/u/apps/ch/opt/mpt/2.19/opt/hpe/hpc/mpt/mpt-2.19/include/mpif.h" --outdir "$casedir/../kgen" -I /gpfs/fs1/work/altuntas/cesm.sandboxes/UFSCOMP.sbx_prectune/components/pop/source/:/gpfs/fs1/work/altuntas/cesm.sandboxes/UFSCOMP.sbx_prectune/components/pop/mpi/:/gpfs/fs1/work/altuntas/cesm.sandboxes/UFSCOMP.sbx_prectune/components/pop/externals/CVMix/src/shared/ -e $casedir/exclude.ini

where exclude.ini is as follows:

[namepath]
pio = skip_module
ifcore = skip_module

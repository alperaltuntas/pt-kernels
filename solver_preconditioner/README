POP2-CESM kernels
altuntas@ucar.edu

The kernels are to be used for optimization/verification studies and usually consist of
 (1) A main Fortran module containing the subroutine targeted for optimization/verification.
     In this kernel, the targeted subroutine is:
        preconditioner (in POP_SolversMod module @ POP_SolversMod.F90)
 (2) auxiliary modules required for dependencies
 (3) data sampled from an actual model run and to be used to run the kernels
 (4) the kernel driver.


Description of the targeted subroutine, "preconditioner":
    The kernel subroutine "preconditioner" applies a precomputed preconditioner as a
		nine-point stencil operator. The POP_SolversMod module contains routines and 
		operators for solving the elliptic system for surface pressure in the barotropic mode.


Notes on Kernel Extraction:
 (*) The following kgen command was executed to extract this kernel on izumi:

  $kgen $target --cmd-clean "cd $casedir; ./case.build --clean-all" --cmd-build "cd $casedir; ./case.build" --cmd-run "cd $casedir; ./case.submit" --timing "repeat=1" --mpi comm=mpi_communicator_ocn,use="ocn_communicator:mpi_communicator_ocn",header="/cluster/mvapich2-2.3-intel-cluster-19.0.1/include/mpif.h" --outdir "$casedir/../kgen" -I /home/altuntas/cesm.sandboxes/UFSCOMP.sbx/components/pop/source/:/home/altuntas/cesm.sandboxes/UFSCOMP.sbx/components/pop/mpi/ -e $casedir/exclude.ini

where exclude.ini is as follows:

[namepath]
pio = skip_module
ifcore = skip_module

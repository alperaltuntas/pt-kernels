POP2-CESM kernels
altuntas@ucar.edu

The kernels are to be used for optimization/verification studies and usually consist of
 (1) A main Fortran module containing the subroutine targeted for optimization/verification.
     In this kernel, the targeted subroutine is:
        merged_streamfunction (in hmix_gm module @ hmix_gm.F90)
 (2) auxiliary modules required for dependencies
 (3) data sampled from an actual model run and to be used to run the kernels
 (4) the kernel driver.


Description of the targeted subroutine, "merged_streamfunction":
    The kernel subroutine "merged_streamfunction" is compute-intensive and
    takes about %3 of POP2-only CESM runs.The subroutine constructs a merged
    streamfunction that has the appropriate behavior in the surface diabatic
    region, transition layer, and adiabatic interior.


Notes on Kernel Extraction:
 (*) The following kgen command was executed to extract this kernel on cheyenne:

  $kgen $target --cmd-clean "cd $casedir; ./case.build --clean-all" --cmd-build "cd $casedir; ./case.build" --cmd-run "cd $casedir; ./case.submit" --timing "repeat=1"  --mpi comm=mpi_communicator_ocn,use="ocn_communicator:mpi_communicator_ocn",header="/glade/u/apps/ch/opt/mpt/2.19/opt/hpe/hpc/mpt/mpt-2.19/include/mpif.h" --outdir "$casedir/../kgen" -I /gpfs/fs1/work/altuntas/cesm.sandboxes/UFSCOMP.sbx_prectune/components/pop/source/:/gpfs/fs1/work/altuntas/cesm.sandboxes/UFSCOMP.sbx_prectune/components/pop/mpi/ -e $casedir/exclude.ini

where exclude.ini is as follows:

[namepath]
pio = skip_module
ifcore = skip_module
